## Evaluating CI

This looks at the actual fits from bdotsBoot, along with histograms of booted parameters relative to seed pars

Re-explores bootstrap alternative, CI, histogram of parameters, thoughts on going forward

## Simulation (Coverage)

Let's look at what actual bootstrap looks like in terms of parameter and pointwise curve coverage

## Permutations

Dude this is SICK!

[Sept 01, 2022](subdir/permutation_and_perm_step.html)

Ok, so here is a look at permuations with new bdots bootstrapping

And here is another of the previous except different
