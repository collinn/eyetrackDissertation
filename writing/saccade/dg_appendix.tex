\section{Recovery of Individual Curves -- Asymmetric Gaussian}

Presented here are the results of the simulations for the recovery of subject-specific curves generated with the asymmetric Gaussian function, the parametric function typically associated with looks to competitors in the VWP. As in the section fitted with the logistic function, simulations include settings in which there is no oculomotor delay, as well as delay that is normally and Weibull distributed. Again, as all fits could not be individual examined, an automated criterion was used to determine which fits were considered  adequate. Here, this stipulated that the estimated sigma parameters be positive and that the height parameter be larger than either of the base parameters. The number of fits retained for the no delay, normal delay, and Weibull delay were  855, 786, and 816, respectively.


\subsection{Results}

As might be expected, the more complicated mean structure provided by the asymmetric Gaussian led to a generalized increase in the difficulty of recovery for both the look onset and proportion methods, relative to those generated with a logistic mean structure. However, we do still find that in the case of no delay, given in Figure~\ref{fig:dg_rep_curves_no_delay}, that the recovery of individual parameters is still unbiased and, as with the logistic, the location parameter (here, mu), is right shifted.

The results for the median integrated squared error are given in Table~\ref{tab:dg_mise_sims}. We again see results similar to those with the logistic in that the look onset method outperforms the proportion of fixation method in all cases.
